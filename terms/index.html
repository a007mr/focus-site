				<div class="py-2">
					<p class="fs2 bold pb-xs">19. Dispute Resolution</p>
					<p class="medium">(a) <span class="medium underline">Generally.</span> In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Focus in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section 19(b), you and Focus agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a courtcan award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND FOCUS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
					<p class="medium mt-2">(b) <span class="medium underline">Exceptions.</span> Despite the provisions of Section 19(a) above, nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p>
					<p class="medium mt-2">(c) <span class="medium underline">Arbitrator.</span> Any arbitration between you and Focus will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “AAA Rules”) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Focus. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.</p>
					<p class="medium mt-2">(d) <span class="medium underline">Notice of Arbitration; Process.</span> A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice of Arbitration”). The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Focus may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Focus must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Focus will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Focus in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $100.</p>
					<p class="medium mt-2">(e) <span class="medium underline">Fees.</span> If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Focus will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $1,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Los Angeles, California, but if the claim is for $1,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Focus for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p>
					<p class="medium mt-2">(f) <span class="medium underline">No Class Actions.</span> YOU AND FOCUS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBERIN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Focus agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>
					<p class="medium mt-2">(g) <span class="medium underline">Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.</span> If Focus makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Focus's address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Focus’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.</p>
					<p class="medium mt-2">(h) <span class="medium underline">Enforceability.</span> If Section 19(f) is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 19 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 19 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 19(e) will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</p>

					<p class="fs2 bold pb-xs">20. Waiver</p>
					<p class="medium">The waiver by either party of any breach of any provision of this Agreement does not waive any other breach. The failure of any party to insist on strict performance of any covenant or obligation in accordance with this Agreement will not be a waiver of such party’s right to demand strict compliance in the future, nor will the same be construed as a novation of this Agreement.</p>

					<p class="medium">This Agreement is the final and complete expression of the agreement between these parties regarding Subscriber’s use of the Service. This Agreement supersedes, and the terms of this Agreement govern, all previous oral and written communications regarding these matters, all of which are merged into this Agreement.
